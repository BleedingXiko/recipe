# Chicken Parmesan

**Description**: Chicken Parmesan is a classic Italian dish featuring crispy chicken cutlets topped with cheese and served with a rich marinara sauce.

## Ingredients

**CHICKEN:**

- 1 c. panko bread crumbs
- 1 tsp. garlic powder
- 2 c. finely grated Parmesan, divided
- 3/4 c. all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 6 (1/4"-thick) boneless, skinless chicken cutlets (about 1 1/2 lb. total)
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 c. shredded mozzarella
- 1 c. vegetable or canola oil
- Chopped fresh basil, for serving

## Instructions

1. In a shallow bowl, combine panko, garlic powder, and 1 cup of Parmesan. Into another shallow bowl, pour the flour. In a third shallow bowl, beat eggs with 1 tablespoon water.

2. Pat the chicken cutlets dry and season with salt and pepper. Dip each cutlet into the flour, shaking off excess, then into the egg, and finally into the panko mixture, gently pressing to adhere.

3. In a small bowl, mix mozzarella and the remaining 1 cup of Parmesan.

4. Heat your broiler. In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, heat the oil until it reaches 350Â°F (if it smokes slightly, that's okay). Set a wire rack on a baking sheet.

5. Working one at a time, fry the chicken cutlets until one side is golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip and continue to fry until golden brown on the other side, about 1 minute more. Transfer to the prepared wire rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken cutlets.

6. Spoon some marinara sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle with the cheese mixture.

7. Broil, watching carefully, until the cheese is melted and brown spots form, about 2 minutes.

8. Divide the chicken Parmesan among plates. Top with chopped fresh basil. Serve with marinara sauce on the side.
