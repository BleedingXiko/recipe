# Grilled Buffalo Chicken Wings

**Description**: These Grilled Buffalo Chicken Wings will spice up your grill game. They're perfectly grilled, with a crisp exterior, and coated in a tangy and spicy sauce. A mouthwatering appetizer for any occasion!

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 3 pounds whole chicken wings
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/3 cup hot sauce
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, combine the kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and garlic powder. In a large bowl, toss the chicken wings with the salt mixture to evenly coat.

2. Preheat a gas grill to medium heat (about 350 degrees F).

3. Place the wings on the grill, crowding them together so that they are all touching (this goes against the conventional wisdom of giving meat room so it doesn't steam; you want them to steam so that they stay moist). Grill, flipping the wings every 5 minutes, for a total of 20 minutes of cooking.

4. In the meantime, heat the butter, hot sauce, vinegar, and honey in a saucepan over low heat and whisk to combine.

5. In a clean large bowl, toss the wings with the sauce. Turn the heat up on the grill to medium-high. Use tongs to remove the wings from the sauce and put them back on the grill until the skins crisp, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Put the wings back in the bowl with the sauce, toss, and serve.
