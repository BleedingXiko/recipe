# Dutch Pancakes

**Description**: Dutch pancakes are a delightful breakfast treat, and they're incredibly easy to make.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- A pinch of salt
- Your favorite toppings (e.g., maple syrup, fresh berries, powdered sugar)

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and a pinch of salt.

2. In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk and melted butter. Mix well.

3. Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry mixture while whisking until you have a smooth batter.

4. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add a little butter to coat the pan.

5. Pour a ladle of the pancake batter into the skillet and swirl it around to cover the bottom evenly.

6. Cook until the edges start to lift and the bottom is golden brown. Flip the pancake and cook the other side until golden.

7. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.

8. Serve your Dutch pancakes hot with your favorite toppings. Enjoy your delicious breakfast!
