# Delicious Chocolate Chip Cookies

**Description**: These chocolate chip cookies are a delightful treat that everyone will love. They are soft, chewy, and loaded with gooey chocolate chips.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.

3. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

5. Gently fold in the chocolate chips to evenly distribute them throughout the cookie dough.

6. Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between each cookie.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers are still soft.

8. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. Enjoy your freshly baked chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk!

These cookies are best enjoyed fresh out of the oven. Store any leftovers in an airtight container to keep them soft and delicious.
