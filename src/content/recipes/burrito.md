# Beef and Bean Burritos

**Description**: These Beef and Bean Burritos are packed with flavor. They feature taco-seasoned ground beef, refried beans, and melted cheese, all wrapped in warm tortillas and served with sour cream and salsa.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 envelope taco seasoning
- 1 can (16 ounces) refried beans
- 6 flour tortillas (12 inches), warmed
- 1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
- 4 teaspoons canola oil
- Sour cream and salsa

## Instructions

1. In a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until it is no longer pink. Drain any excess fat. Stir in the taco seasoning, then remove the beef mixture from the skillet and set it aside. Wipe the skillet clean.

2. In a small saucepan, cook the refried beans over medium-low heat until they are heated through, which takes about 2-3 minutes.

3. Spoon about 1/3 cup of beans off-center on each tortilla. Top with 1/4 cup of the beef mixture and sprinkle with cheese. Fold the sides and ends of the tortillas over the filling and roll them up.

4. In the same skillet over medium-high heat, brown the burritos in oil on all sides.

5. Serve the Beef and Bean Burritos with sour cream and salsa.
