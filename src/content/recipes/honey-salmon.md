# Honey Soy Glazed Salmon

**Description**: This honey soy glazed salmon is a delightful dish that combines the sweet and savory flavors of honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. The result is a perfectly crispy and flavorful salmon.

## Ingredients

- 12 oz skinless salmon
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

**Honey Soy Marinade:**

- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons ginger, minced
- ½ teaspoon red pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce
- ⅓ cup honey

## Instructions

1. Place the salmon in a sealable bag or a medium bowl.

2. In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix the ingredients for the honey soy marinade.

3. Pour half of the marinade over the salmon, saving the other half for later.

4. Let the salmon marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

5. In a medium pan, heat the olive oil. Add the salmon to the pan, but discard the used marinade. Cook the salmon on one side for about 2-3 minutes, then flip it over and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.

6. Remove the salmon from the pan. Pour in the remaining marinade and reduce it.

7. Serve the salmon with the sauce and your choice of side dishes. We recommend serving it with broccoli.

8. Enjoy your delicious honey soy glazed salmon!
